# hyperskill-coffee-machine-java

This is a Java learning project from Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy, more details here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?goal=7

In this project, I implemented a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
